## Hypertext Markup Language

- html layer: the actual content that will be rendered in a web page

- Recall your earlier school days when your teacher returned your homework with red marks on it. Misspelled words, bad grammar, or other such mistakes would be circled or highlighted. You might call that a marked-up document.

- Similarly, a markup language is used to call out parts of the document and provide instructions or background information. The markup is provided to the browser as instructions for how this should be rendered. As such, this markup itself must be syntactically precise.

- HTML5 is a relatively mature standard, or more accurately, a set of standards that is managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

### HTML Document

- HTML is generally produced and consumed as a document. We may talk about snippets of HTML but in most cases, a web site will respond to a request with a complete HTML document, which is then parsed by the client and rendered on a device.

- ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>HTML5 Sample Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      Hello World!
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

### Elements

- The document is comprised of several HTML elements that are nested in a hierarchical fashion

- Like other markup languages, tags are used to annotate content with useful information

- ```html
  <tag attribute="value" ...> content </tag>
  ```

- In most cases each element has an open and close tag that are identical except the close tag is preceded by a “/” character. Sometimes the terms element and tag are used interchangeably;

- to be precise, however, an element is comprised of an opening and closing tag and the content that is found between these tags.

- Elements will often contain other elements. For better readability, this nested hierarchy is illustrated by indenting child elements.

### DOCTYPE

- The DOCTYPE element is an oddity and doesn’t fit any of the standard element formats. There is a bit of history behind it as well. In the early days of web development (think IE4 and Netscape), web pages were developed against how the current browsers were implemented

- As the HTML specifications evolved and matured, new browsers developed against the updated specifications would not work with the older web pages.

- The DOCTYPE element was introduced so each page could specify the version of the specification that it was written against. The browser would need to interpret this and provide the necessary backward compatibility.

- Fortunately, with HTML5 the DOCTYPE can be essentially ignored. Just set it to html:

- ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

### Attributes

- An opening tag can include one or more attributes. Attributes are used to provide details about an element.

- The html element, for example, contains lang="en", which informs the browser that the content is written in English. The browser may use this to offer to translate the content if English is not the current language.

- There is a set of attributes called global attributes that can be used on any HTML element. The most common ones that you’ll use are `id`, `class` and `dir`. The id attribute defines a unique key for an element; it must be unique within the entire HTML document. This is often used when accessing an element in JavaScript. The class attribute is sometimes called the CSS class, because it is often used for applying styles to an element. Unlike id, the class attribute is a non-unique key; a single value is applied to elements that need to have identical formatting.

- In addition to the global attributes, each element type may support other attributes. Notice that the meta element includes a charset attribute:

- ```html
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  ```

- The charset attribute specifies the type of character-set encoding that this page uses You should always define the character set; however, this is particularly important if your page needs to display nonstandard characters.

- There are some Boolean attributes that do not need a value; their existence indicates a true value and their absence means false. For example, a check box has a checked attribute if checked and this attribute is removed if not checked. You may see something like checked="checked", especially in dynamic HTML that is generated by server-side code. However, the browser will ignore the value and you only need to include the attribute; no value is needed.

### Miscellaneous Structure Rules

- Notice that the meta element does not have a closing tag. There are a few elements that do not have to use a closing tag, which are referred to as self-closing tags. It may be somewhat obvious, but these elements cannot have any content since the content is placed between the opening and closing tags. The “/” character at the end of the tag is technically optional, but the general consensus is that it should be included and some HTML validators will flag this as a warning if it’s not there.

- Keep in mind that whitespace characters such as tabs, carriage returns, and extra spaces are ignored by the browser. You can left-align all of the text and the rendered HTML will be identical. You could even put the entire document on a single line if you really wanted to. But the general convention and best practice is to format the HTML like it is shown here.

- HTML tags are case insensitive. The general convention is to use all lowercase tags and I’ll be doing that throughout this book. But you could use `<HEAD>` or `<Head>` and it would be just as valid.

## Html Element

- So, as you’ve already seen, the html element is the root node: the starting point of your document. There’s not much to say about it. The html element can contain one head element and one body element. In addition to the global attributes, it also supports the manifest attribute.

- ```html
  <html dir="ltr" manifest="www.mywebsite.com/cache.appcache"></html>
  ```

## Head Element

- There’s not any real content in the head element; that’s what the body element is for Now let’s look at the elements that can be included inside the head element. You’ve already seen the title and meta elements, which I’ll cover in a little more detail. There are a few other useful elements that belong here as well.

### Head Related Elements

#### Title Element

- ```html
  <title>Sample Document</title>
  ```

- The title element specifies the title of this page. This shows up in a couple of places:

  - In the browser title bar or tab
  - Search engines will usually include this in the search results
  - When adding a page to your favorites or bookmark, the title is used as the name

- Although somewhat obvious, you can only have one title element in your document. If you choose to ignore this rule, the browser will usually display the first title element and ignore the rest.

#### Meta Element

- The meta element is an abbreviation for metadata, which is data that describes other data. In this case, the meta element describes the contents of the HTML document. The head element can include any number of meta elements, each providing a single data point using the name/value pair construct

- ```html
  <meta name="author" content="Hosein Ghanbari" />
  <meta name="description" content="Sample HTML document" />
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30" />
  ```

- The value portion of the name/value pair is specified in the `content` attribute; however, the name portion is either defined in the `name` attribute or the `http-equiv` attribute, depending on the type of data being set.

- The name attribute is used for metadata that describes the content of the HTML document. The most common values for the name attribute are application-name, author, description, and keywords. These are all fairly self-explanatory. For keywords, the content attribute will contain a comma-separated list of keywords.

- The http-equiv attribute is used to simulate an http response header. The more common values are these:

  - content-type: the content attribute will specify a content type, typically text/html and a character set. For example, `content = "text/html; charset=UTF-8"`.
  - default-style - use this to specify the default style sheet
  - refresh - you can force the page to automatically refresh after a certain interval,
    which is specified, in seconds, in the content attribute.

- As demonstrated in the sample document, the character set can also be specified using the shortened notation: <meta charset="utf-8" />.

- There are a lot of other meta names that you can use.

#### Script Element

- The script element is used to load JavaScript in your page. In order to use a function, you must either define it or load an external script file that contains the function. Either can be done in the script element.

- ```html
  <script type="text/javascript">
    function doSomething() {
      alert("Hello World!");
    }
  </script>
  ```

- The type attribute is optional and will default to text/javascript if not specified. This was required in HTML4 and you’ll see it included quite often.

- It is generally considered best practice to put JavaScript into a separate external file. One big advantage of doing that is to share the same script across multiple pages. To reference an external file, use the src attribute and do not include any content between the opening and closing tags. If you need to load multiple files, include each one in a separate script element.

- ```html
  <script src="../scripts/sample.js"></script>
  <script src="../scripts/demo.js"></script>
  ```

- Normally, as the browser is parsing an HTML document, when a script element is encountered, the script is loaded and executed before continuing to parse the rest of the document. For external files, you can use the async or defer attributes to change this behavior. Both of these are Boolean attributes.

- If the async attribute is specified, the file is loaded and executed in parallel, while the parsing process continues. Alternatively, if the defer attribute is used, the script will be executed only after the page has been fully parsed.

- ```html
  <script src="../scripts/demo.js" defer></script>
  ```

- You should use the defer attribute if the script has code that references any of the HTML elements. If it executes before the document is parsed, the script might fail because the elements are not yet available.

#### Link Element

- The link element is used to reference additional external resources, which can be grouped into two categories. First, links are used to load resources that are used to render the source document – the most common of these being cascading style sheets. The second category is links to other related documents. The reader may choose to navigate to these documents but they are not needed to render the current page.

- The link element uses a self-closing tag, and the linked resource is specified entirely through attributes. This is done through the href attribute that defines the address of the resource and the rel attribute. The rel attribute, an abbreviation for relationship, indicates the relationship between the source document and the linked resource.

- ```html
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="site.ico" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sample.css" />
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/plain" href="page.txt" />
  ```

- The link element can be used to reference many different types of resources for a lot of different reasons. Unfortunately, the term relationship does not always convey the best meaning of this attribute. For some of the most common values such as stylesheet and icon, this may be better interpreted as the type of resource rather than a relationship. For some, such as first, next, and alternate, relationship is indeed the proper term to use. However, for the sake of consistency, the rel attribute is used for all linked resources.

#### Style Element

- The specific style attributes of an element such as color or size can be specified explicitly on the element, which is referred to as inline styles. The more common, and preferred, method however, is to define a set of rules that are used to determine the specific style attributes that are applied to the entire document.

- These rules are either included in an external style sheet (and referenced through the link element), or they are defined in a style element. In this regard, the style element is somewhat analogous to the script element, except it includes CSS content instead of JavaScript.

- There is one big difference between the style element and the script element. The script element is used for including JavaScript either in the content of the script element, or by referencing an external file with the src attribute. When including styles, you use the style element to define styles; however, the link element is used to load an external file. Another difference is that a link element can only be used inside a head element; a style element can be used in either a head or body element, although this is not widely supported yet.

- ```html
  <style>
    html {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  ```

- The style element supports the media attribute, which allows you to include a media query. A media query is a Boolean expression that can conditionally apply a set of styles. The styles are applied only if the expression evaluates to true. Media queries were originally intended to allow the same document to be formatted differently when rendered in print form. For example, the following style is applied only when printing a document:

- ```html
  <style media="print">
    html {
      color: black;
    }
  </style>
  ```

- However, media queries have been enhanced significantly giving you the ability to adjust the styles based on many different factors. One of the more common uses of this is in creating a responsive design where the format and layout of the page automatically adjusts depending on the screen resolution.

#### Base Element

- The base element is used to define the base URL that should be used for all other references in the document. This allows you to use relative URLs everywhere else. This saves a bit of typing but also makes it easy if you need to change the base address. The base element supports two specific attributes: href, which defines the base URL; and target, which specifies the default behavior when a link is selected.

- ```html
  <base href="www.example.com/html5" target="_self" />
  ```

- The base element should be the first child of the head element, or at least come before any link elements so the base address will be applied to subsequent link elements.

- As you can see, the base element uses a self-closing tag. Setting the target attribute to \_self indicates that the link should be opened in the same window and tab as the current page. This can be overridden by assigning a different target in a specific link. The supported values for the target attribute are these:

  - \_blank - opens in a new window or tab
  - \_self - opens in the current window or tab (this is the default value if no target is
    specified)
  - \_parent - opens in the parent frame
  - \_top - opens in the topmost frame

- The frameset and frame elements are not supported in HTML5 so the \_parent and \_top values are not applicable unless you are using an iframe.

### Examples

- <iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/html5-head-related-tags-2bpnh?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="HTML5 Example 1"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

## Body Element

- HTML5 is all about semantics.The choice of which element to use is an important one.It conveys the meaning or purpose of the content.

  - **Structural** elements, such as header, footer, section, aside, and div. These create a skeleton that will support the remaining content.
  - **Text** elements – there is a large set of elements that contain primarily text content, and each provides a specific semantic meaning.
  - **Table** elements – these elements are used to arrange tabular data that logically belongs in rows and columns.
  - **Embedded** elements, such as img, audio, and video.
  - **Form** elements, including input, button, label, and other elements used to create data entry forms.

### Structural HTML Elements

#### Sectioning Content

- It’s a good idea to organize your HTML document into logical sections, especially for larger documents. Prior to HTML5 the division (div) element was used to group content and they can be nested like this:

- ```html
  <div>
    <div>
      <div></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

- Unfortunately, a div can be used to group content for a lot of different reasons, which are not obvious to the reader. HTML5 introduces several new elements that provide more specific semantic groupings. Each of these elements are used to group content into a larger unit. Each one, however, groups the content for a different reason. You could accomplish the grouping with the generic div element; the reason to use the more specific element is to make it clear why the group is being made. So pay close attention to the specific purpose of each element and use the correct one depending on what you’re trying to accomplish.

##### Section Element

- The section element is used to organize content into logical sections. Think back to an essay you may have written for a school assignment where you’d have an introduction, three main points, and a conclusion. Each of these would be represented in HTML as a section. Also, section elements can be nested just like div elements. If each of your main points have subpoints, you can use a section for each subpoint.

- There are two guiding principles in choosing your section elements. First, sections should be topical; you’re organizing content based on the material being presented. Second, sections should flow linearly. For example, the introduction flows into the first main point, and so on. The antithesis of this will be more apparent when I discuss the aside element.

##### Article Element

- An article element is used to group content that can stand on its own. This is typically used when the content is being reused. The same concept is true of web sites, where syndicated content is included in multiple pages. These should be placed in an article element because the content is independent of the rest of the page.

- However, one of the most common uses of the article element is on blogs. Each post on a blog is generally stand-alone content and is often grouped into an article element. Also, comments that are posted to a blog are also typically placed in an article element.

- You can use an article element anywhere you would use a section element, if the content is independent and reusable. Also, an article element can include other article elements, as would be the case with a blog post including comments.

##### Aside Element

- An aside element is used to group content that does not belong in the normal flow of your document. This could be supporting information provided for reference purposes, or perhaps information about the author. It could also be unrelated information such as advertising space or a calendar of events.

- The aside element is often presented as a sidebar so it doesn’t interrupt the flow of the other content. However, the CSS will determine that; the job of a content author is to indicate that a group of content is not part of the normal content flow. And this is done with the aside element.

##### Nav Element

- The nav element is used to group a set of links. A typical example is where you have some sort of menu on the page to jump to internal bookmarks or other related pages. Another example is where you provide links for more information or related material.

- You don’t have to put every link into a nav element. But if you do have content that is comprised primarily of links, put this in a nav element. This will indicate that this section of content provides navigation.

##### Address Element

- The address element is not included in the sectioning content. I am describing it here because it is used to provide contact information for either the entire document or for a specific article. To use it for a single article it should be placed somewhere inside the article element. If it applied to the document, it must be inside the body element; this is often placed in the footer element.

- The address element is intended for providing contact information related to a document or article. This can include an email address, URL, phone number, mailing address, or any other method of communicating with the author. It may have been better named contact because that is what it should be used for. You should not use it to describe an address unless the address is provided as contact information.

- ```html
  <footer>
    <p>Closing content</p>
    <address>
      <p>
        Provided by
        <a href="mailto:info@example.com">Example Group</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information
        <a href="www.example.com">visit his website</a>
      </p>
    </address>
  </footer>
  ```

#### Outlines

##### Explicit Sections

- There is a notion in the HTML5 specifications regarding document outlines that is referred to as the outline algorithm. The document outlining algorithm is a mechanism for producing outline summaries of Web pages based on how they are marked up. The body element, which is the root element for your content, creates a topmost node in the document outline. Adding any of the sectioning elements, section, article, aside, or nav, will create a new section in the outline. Embedding additional sectioning elements will add more nodes to the outline. The idea here is that by simply nesting sectioning elements, an explicit outline is created for your document. Creating an outline without any labels is not very interesting. So we’ll add an h1 element within each section to give it a name.

- ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>HTML5 Sample Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>My Sample Page</h1>
      <nav>
        <h1>Navigation</h1>
      </nav>
      <section>
        <h1>Top-level</h1>
        <section>
          <h1>Main content</h1>
          <section>
            <h1>Featured content</h1>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Articles</h1>
            <article>
              <h1>Article 1</h1>
            </article>
          </section>
        </section>
        <aside>
          <h1>Related content</h1>
          <section>
            <h1>HTML Reference</h1>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Book list</h1>
            <article>
              <h1>Book 1</h1>
            </article>
          </section>
        </aside>
      </section>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

- <img class="img-fluid" src="./assets/image/explicit_outline.jpg" />

##### Document Headings (Implicit Sections)

- HTML5 supports document heading elements.Each of these is used to indicate that the heading belongs at the specified level in the document outline.
- Prior to HTML5, the sectioning elements did not exist. However, using the h1–h6 elements, you could provide implicit sections. If the previous heading used an h2 element and the current heading uses h3, a new section is implicitly defined. Similarly, going from h3 to h2 closes the current section.

- ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>HTML5 Sample Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>My Sample Page</h1>
      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <h2>Top-level</h2>
      <h3>Main content</h3>
      <h4>Featured content</h4>
      <h4>Articles</h4>
      <h5>Article 1</h5>
      <h3>Related content</h3>
      <h4>HTML Reference</h4>
      <h4>Book list</h4>
      <h5>Book 1</h5>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

- The official W3C recommendation, however, is to not rely on the outlining of the sectioning elements. You should definitely use the sectioning elements to organize your HTML document into sections. This warning is recommending that you also use the corresponding h1–h6 element depending on the document hierarchy where this is feasible.

##### Header and Footer Element

- While organizing your page, you should also consider adding a header element at the top and a footer element at the bottom. These elements allow you to group introductory or concluding content for a section of the document.

- Unlike the sectioning elements such as article or section, the header and footer elements do not create a new section in the document outline. Rather they are used to group content for the section that they are placed in. You will typically use a header and a footer element in the body element to define the page header and footer. They can also be placed inside a child section such as a section element. In this case, they will group introductory content for the section only.

#### Planning the Page Layout

- Before creating a new web page, it’s a good idea to sketch out the basic page structure. This will help you visualize the overall layout and see how the elements are nested together.

- The page that I will demonstrate in this chapter will use header and nav elements at the top and a footer element at the bottom. The main area in the middle will use a section element and have two side-by-side areas, each with a series of article tags. The larger area will be enclosed within another section element and provide the primary content, which is organized into article elements. The smaller area, on the right, will use an aside element and will contain a section element. This will contain a series of article elements that will present related information

- <img class="img-fluid" src="./assets/image/page_layout.jpg" />

#### Sectioning Roots

- There are a few HTML elements that are called sectioning roots, which have their own outline that does not contribute to the outline of the rest of the document.

- The body element is one of these elements, although this is arguably a special case; the outline of the body element is the document’s outline. The other elements in this category include blockquote, details, fieldset, figure, and td.

##### Blockquote Element

- The blockquote element is used when you need to include a long quotation in a document. The contents of the quote are placed inside the blockquote element and can consist of multiple elements including header text, paragraphs, and embedded content.

- ```html
  <blockquote cite="www.apress.com">
    <h1>Quotation</h1>
    <p>This is a quotation</p>
  </blockquote>
  ```

- The header text (h1–h6) will define sections within the quotation, but these will not be part of the document outline. You can verify this yourself by adding a blockquote element to your document and running it through the outlining tool https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/

- In addition to the global attributes, the blockquote element supports the cite attribute. Use this to identify the URL of the source of the quote or a resource containing information about the quote.

- The cite attribute provides details about the quote but it is not displayed, at least not normally. The browser could use this information but it’s basically provided as metadata. To display the source or a citation you should use the cite element.

##### Details Element

- The details element allows you to create collapsible sections of content. Inside the details element you can include an optional summary element that will contain the content that is displayed when the element is collapsed. If no summary element is used, the collapsed text will be “Details”

- The remaining content of the details element will be hidden when collapsed. The initial state of the details element will be collapsed. If you want the contents to be displayed when the page is loaded, add the open Boolean attribute.

- ```html
  <details open>
    <summary>This is the collapsed text</summary>
    <h1>Details</h1>
    <p>These are collapsable details</p>
  </details>
  ```

- Again, like the other sectioning root elements, you can include h1–h6 elements in the details element, which will define an outline for the details. However, these sections are not included in the document outline.

- As of this writing, the details element is not supported by Internet Explorer or Edge and is not fully supported by Firefox.

##### Figure Element

- The figure element is used to group content that is self-contained and can be logically moved to a different location without affecting the main flow of the document. A unique feature of the figure element is the ability to include a caption within the content.

- A figure element is typically used to group an image or some other embedded content along with a caption. It can also be used to group text, such as a code listing along with a caption.

- To add a caption, include the figcaption element within the figure element. The figcaption element must be the first or last child element in the figure element. The caption will be above the content if the figcaption element is the first child element. Otherwise, it will be below the content.

- ```html
  <figure>
    <h1>Figure</h1>
    <img src="HTML5Badge.png" alt="HTML5" />
    <figcaption>Official HTML5 Logo</figcaption>
  </figure>
  ```

#### Grouping Elements

- These elements are used for primarily semantic purposes and do not affect the document outline.

##### Paragraph Element

- The paragraph (p) element is used to define a paragraph, which is a section of text that contains a single thought or idea. It is normally visually distinct from other paragraphs.

- The p element is probably one of the most overused elements. I can’t stress this enough - the element that is chosen should be based on its semantic meaning. A paragraph is a distinct portion of a document that contains a single thought or idea. If that describes the content you are adding, use a p element. If not, keep looking. The next chapter will describe the phrasing elements and one of these may be more appropriate.

- If you use the appropriate element, the default styling will usually make sense as well. But you’re not selecting the element based on the style that it is given. The styles can be easily changed through CSS as long as the appropriate elements are consistently used.

##### Horizontal Rule Element

- In HTML4, the hr element was used to create a horizontal rule, or line. Since HTML5 provides more semantic definition to its elements, this has been redefined as a thematic break. This is usually placed between paragraphs when there is a change of topic.

- The hr element is still rendered as a horizontal line for backward compatibility. Of course this can be modified through CSS. There is no content within the hr element and the closing tag is not needed. Add an hr element like this:

- ```html
  <p>paragraph 1</p>
  <hr />
  <p>paragraph 2</p>
  ```

##### Preformatted Element

- Content placed inside a preformatted (pre) element will be rendered just like it is entered, including white space. Because white space, including carriage returns, tabs, and extra spaces, are normally ignored by the browser. Use the pre element to tell the browser to include them. The default style will use a fixed-spaced font, which also aids in preserving the format.

- The pre element is one of the rare exceptions where its use is not primarily for semantic reasons.

- The pre element is used to include content that is already formatted and you want to maintain that format. Including a snippet of code is a good example. Another common use of the pre element is when including poetry.

##### Main Element

- The main element is used to indicate that its contents present the primary purpose or topic of the document. This identifies the core, the central theme of the document. As such, the main element cannot be inside an article, aside, footer, header, or nav elements, since these are used for ancillary content. Also you can only have one main element per document, which should be fairly obvious. The content in the main element should be unique to the document and not shared by other documents.

- Of course, the main element can be divided into sections as appropriate. Although there is no restriction on including an article, aside, or nav element within a main element, this is generally considered poor form. An article contains reusable or stand-alone material so it will seldom be unique to the document. An aside element is used for content that is not part of the main flow and is likely not part of the central theme that the main element is reserved for. However, if the content of aside or article elements satisfies the criteria of a main element, you can use them as well.

- There is no default styling for a main element; its use is purely semantic. Using it helps applications such as screen readers or search engines go straight to the core content of your document.

##### Division Element

- Prior to HTML5, the div element was used for all types of groupings. Now we have new elements to use for specific purposes: topically (section), independent or reusable content (article), outside of normal flow (aside), and navigation (nav). There are also several elements that are available for semantic grouping such as the main, figure, and blockquote elements. The div element is used for all other grouping reasons.

- One common use of the div element is to apply styles to all of its child elements. Most style attributes are inherited from the parent element. So setting an attribute on a div element will propagate down to all the elements within the div.

#### Listing Elements

##### Ordered List Element / Unordered List Element

- HTML5 supports both an ordered list using the ol element as well as an unordered list using the ul element. They work pretty much the same except for a few additional attributes that are available with an ordered list.

- With either list, the order of the elements is fixed and defined by the order that the items are included in the list. The appropriate type is chosen based on semantics. If the order of the list is not meaningful, use the unordered list. If the order is meaningful you should use an ordered list.

- The default style of an unordered list is to prefix each item with a bullet of some type and the same bullet is used for all of the items. For an ordered list, the default style will use a number, and the numbers will be assigned sequentially

- The items within a list (either ordered or unordered) are represented by a list item (li) element. The only elements that can be included inside either a ul or ol element are li elements. However, you can put any flow element inside an li element.

- ```html
  <h2>Book Topics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>HTML Chapters</h2>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Structural Elements</li>
    <li>Text Elements</li>
    <li>Table Elements</li>
    <li>Embedded Elements</li>
    <li>Form Elements</li>
  </ol>
  ```

- As I mentioned, the ordered list supports a few additional attributes. The most common one is the start attribute, which I used in the previous example.The start attribute indicates the number to use for the first li element; in this case 4. If omitted, the numbering will start with 1.

- The reversed attribute is a Boolean attribute that is used to assign the numbers in reverse order. You would use this, for example, if you were listing the top three most popular sports and wanted to leave the most popular for last. The numbering would be in reverse order, 3, 2, 1. If you do not specify the start attribute, the number of the first item is set so that the last element will be 1. If you put ten items in a list and specify the reversed attribute with no start attribute, the items will be numbered from 10 to 1. If you do specify start along with reversed, the first item will use whatever was specified in the start attribute and the rest will go down from there, so you could end up with negative numbers.

- The reversed attribute does not change the order of the li elements. They are always rendered in the order they are included in the list. The reversed attribute only affects the numbering of the items.

- The type attribute specifies what type of “numbering” to use. Here are the supported values:

  - 1 - Use numbers (this is the default value if not specified)
  - A - Use uppercase letters (e.g., A, B, C, D)
  - a - Use lowercase letters
  - I - Use Roman numerals with uppercase letters (e.g., I, II, III, IV)
  - i - Use lowercase Roman numerals

- The start attribute is always numeric regardless of what value is specified for type. It will be converted to the appropriate type representation. For example, if you specify 4 and the type is I, the first element will use IV.

- Letters or Roman numerals do not support zero or negative numbers. If these values are needed, they will be displayed as numbers. For example, if you have five items in the list and specify the ol element as `<ol start="3" type="a" reversed>`, the numbering will be c, b, a, 0, -1.

- You can use a list to present a series of links such as a menu. For example:

- ```html
  <nav>
    <h1>Navigation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.example.com">My Site</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  ```

##### Description List Element

- The description list (dl) element is used define a list of terms. It is implemented as a set of name/value pairs. It is often used to create a glossary. In this case the names are the terms being defined and the values are the definition or description of those terms. You can put series of term (dt) elements and description (dd) elements inside the dl element.

- ```html
  <dl>
    <dt>Term1</dt>
    <dd>Definition</dd>
    <dt>Term2</dt>
    <dd>Definition</dd>
  </dl>
  ```

- However, you’re not restricted to this one-to-one mapping. Another use of the dl element is to list groups of things with a group header. You accomplish this by using the dt element as the group header and the dd elements as the group members.

- ```html
  <h2>New York Yankees Starting Lineup</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Infielders</dt>
    <dd>Teixeira, 1B</dd>
    <dd>Castro, 2B</dd>
    <dd>Gregorius, SS</dd>
    <dd>Torreyes, 3B</dd>
    <dd>McCann, C</dd>

    <dt>Outfielders</dt>
    <dd>Hicks, LF</dd>
    <dd>Ellsbury, CF</dd>
    <dd>Ackley, RF</dd>

    <dt>Designated Hitter</dt>
    <dd>Rodriguez, DH</dd>

    <dt>Pitchers</dt>
    <dd>Gausman, R</dd>
    <dd>Wilson, R</dd>
    <dd>Tillman, R</dd>
    <dd>Price, L</dd>
    <dd>Porcello, R</dd>
  </dl>
  ```

- The other possibility is to have multiple terms refer to the same description. You can do this as well but you need to keep the like terms together. For example:

- ```html
  <dl>
    <dt>Hicks, LF</dt>
    <dt>Ellsbury, CF</dt>
    <dt>Ackley, RF</dt>

    <dd>
      Outfielders - the positions in baseball that are played in the grassy area
      behind the diamond, known as the outfield. These positions include the
      Left Fielder, Center Fielder, and Right Fielder.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  ```

- The term element is intended to be relatively short such as a word or phrase. There are specific limitations as what kind of elements can be included in a dt element. You cannot use a header, footer, or any sectioning content inside a dt element. Even at that, there’s nothing to prevent you from including paragraphs of content inside a dt element. That is inappropriate, however, when you consider the semantic rules. A dl element is used to describe a list of terms, and a paragraph of text is not a term. There are no such restrictions on the definition element. You can place any flow content inside a dd element, including sectioning and embedded content.

#### Inline Frames Element

- The iframe element is used to embed another web page within the current document. You can include an iframe with markup like this:

- ```html
  <iframe src="http://www.example.com" width="100%" height="400">
    <p>Your browser does not support iframes</p>
  </iframe>
  ```

- The content inside the iframe element will be rendered only if the iframe element is not supported by the browser. The iframe element supports several attributes that you can use to configure how the element is rendered and what options it will allow.

  - `allowfullscreen` - If this Boolean attribute is specified, scripts within the embedded page may switch to fullscreen mode using the requestFullScreen() method call.
  - `height` - The height of the iframe element in pixels or a percentage of the parent page.
  - `name` - The name attribute can be used when providing a link to the iframe from within the parent document.
  - `sandbox` - This can be used to restrict what can be done in the embedded page.
  - `src` - This is used to specify the URL of the page that should be embedded.
  - `srcdoc` - If specified and supported, the srcdoc attribute will override the value of the src attribute. This is normally used in conjunction with the sandbox attribute.
  - `width` - The width of the iframe element in pixels or a percentage of the parent page.

#### Deprecated Elements

- Some grouping elements have been dropped from the HTML5 specification. These are likely to be supported for some time to ensure backward compatibility. However, you should not use these for any new development.

  - `hgroup`
  - `dir`
  - `frame`
  - `frameset`

#### Summary

- A document is organized using sectioning elements to define the larger sections of the document. These along with the heading elements (h1–h6) define the document outline. The header and footer elements are used to identify introductory and concluding content both at the document level as well as within a section. Sectioning roots including blockquote, details, and figure elements have their own sections that do not affect the document outline.

- There are several other grouping elements that do not affect the outline but provide semantic grouping at a lower level. These include the main, paragraph (p), horizontal rule (hr), and division (div) elements. The preformatted (pre) element is used primarily to preserve the formatting of the content, rather than for semantic reasons. Finally, ordered lists (ol), unordered lists (ul), and description lists (dl) provide ways to present a list of things.

- By using these elements, you provide semantic details about your content, which will make it easier to apply consistent styling rules. Even without any custom CSS, the document begins to take “shape” as the default styling renders the content consistently with the semantic purposes of each element.

      proposition that all men are created equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
      any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
      here on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
      portion of it, as a final resting place for those who here gave their
      lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
      that we should do this.

#### Summary

- Make a careful choice when selecting an element to use when including content in your HTML document. Sure, you can put everything in a paragraph or span tag and it will “work.” But each element provides semantic meaning to your content. This will ultimately make your document more maintainable, and when it comes time to write the CSS, you’ll be glad you did.

#### Spanning Cells

#### Summary

- A table consists of rows that are represented by the table row (tr) element. Each row contains a collection of table cells (td) and/or table head cell (th) elements. Columns are not explicitly defined but are inferred based on the existence of td or th elements. For example, the first element of each row is considered the first column.

- You can define columns using the colgroup and/or col element. This does not actually create or define any table cells but allows you to apply styles to a specific column or group of columns. You can also group table rows into a header (thead), body (tbody), and footer (tfoot) elements for semantic purposes.

- Finally, you can merge cells into a single cell by using the colspan and rowspan attributes. Since the merged cell will take up more space, you will need fewer elements in a row that contains a merged cell. Using the rowspan attribute is particularly interesting, requiring you to skip cells in subsequent rows. I recommend you add comments to your table to indicate skipped cells.

#### Summary

- In this chapter, I explained how to embed external content into an HTML5 document. The primary types of embedded content are images, audio, and video and HTML5 supports specific elements for each of these types. You can provide multiple image files and let the browser choose the most appropriate one to download and render based on the device characteristics. You can also define clickable areas on an image that can be used as links.

- The major browsers have all standardized on MP3 for audio and MP4 for video, making it pretty easy to include either in an HTML document. For both audio and video, you can also include time-synchronized text that will appear as subtitles, captions, or other details.

- For other types of embedded content, the object element provides a standardized way of including it. This may require custom browser plug-ins but the object element is a consistent way for referencing them. You can also provide fallback content for when the plug-in is not supported.

### HTML Form Elements

- ```html
  <form action="" method="get">
    <label for="iFirstName">First Name:</label>
    <input id="iFirstName" type="text" />
    <label for="iLastName">Last Name:</label>
    <input id="iLastName" type="text" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  </form>
  ```

- ```html
  <datalist id="sports">
    <option value="Baseball" />
    <option value="Basketball" />
    <option value="Hockey" />
    <option value="Football" />
  </datalist>
  <label for="iSport">Favorite Sport:</label>

#### Summary

- In this chapter I explained how forms are submitted and the input element that is used to collect this information. The same input element is used for almost every type of information. The type attribute is used to indicate the specific data input and validation that should be used.

- In this chapter I explained the capabilities that are provided by most major browsers. There are a few that have somewhat limited support, as of this writing, which I have pointed out. You should be able to use everything I have demonstrated with confidence that most of your users will have a good experience. Check with sites such as html5test.com, to see the latest browser support, as new capabilities are released periodically.
