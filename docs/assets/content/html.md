## Hypertext Markup Language

- html layer: the actual content that will be rendered in a web page

- Recall your earlier school days when your teacher returned your homework with red marks on it. Misspelled words, bad grammar, or other such mistakes would be circled or highlighted. You might call that a marked-up document.

- Similarly, a markup language is used to call out parts of the document and provide instructions or background information. The markup is provided to the browser as instructions for how this should be rendered. As such, this markup itself must be syntactically precise.

- HTML5 is a relatively mature standard, or more accurately, a set of standards that is managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
